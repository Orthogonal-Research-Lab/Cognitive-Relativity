## Super-perceptors and Ultra-High Frequency sampling

H1: For super-perceptors, UHF samples thwart ability to plan (cannot access an internal model).

H2: For super-perceptors, UHF samples appear as aliased information.

Relativity:

fundamental limit (_f_) is the ability to integrate information. Curve becomes nonlinear as it reaches (_f_). This is the so-called relativistic regime.

## Planning (definition)

Planning is the need to infer frames in-between sensed samples (the higher the value, the more divergent), sampling is the ability to capture information over interval _t_.

For super-predators, planning reveals paths to access UHF samples.

Tradeoff between sampling rate (low) and planning ability (high). Relativity is where this tradeoff breaks down, in the presence of UHF stimuli.
