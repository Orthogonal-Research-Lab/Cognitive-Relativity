## Possible tests for Intelligent Thinking

1) stochastic geneator (resembles Figure 15C in Bacillaria I). CPG (central pattern generator).  

2) have a "Floater on Ice" test, send sparse commands such as "move left" and measure the response.  

3) create a planning/sampling continuum, tradeoff between linear and nonlinear responses.

4) citation: "[The shift from life in water to life on land advantaged planning in visually-guided behavior](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/585760v2)". 

* no planning is analogous to an oscillator ([passive dynamic walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_dynamics)).
